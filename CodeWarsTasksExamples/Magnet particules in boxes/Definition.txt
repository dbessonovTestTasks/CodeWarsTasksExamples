Task:

To help Professor Chambouliard can we calculate the function doubles that will take as parameter maxk and maxn such that doubles(maxk, maxn) = S(maxk, maxn)? Experiences seems to show that this could be something around 0.7 when maxk and maxn are big enough.
Examples:

doubles(1, 3)  => 0.4236111111111111
doubles(1, 10) => 0.5580321939764581
doubles(10, 100) => 0.6832948559787737

Notes:

    In u(1, N) the dot is the multiplication operator.

    Don't truncate or round: Have a look in "RUN EXAMPLES" at "assertFuzzyEquals".
